    <h2>About Jonathen Akens</h2><br>
    <p>
       Hi! I'm Jonathen! It is nice to meet you! I am a guy that was born and raised in Terre Haute, Indiana in the US. 
       I have many dreams so let me tell you about them if you are interested. 
       I love a lot of Asian culture, I think the one I love the most is Japanese Culture. One of these days I would love to live in Japan.
       One of the things I love about Asian Culture (World Culture now) this the wide spread popularity of e-sports.
       I'm no exception, I love them too, I'm just not that good at the games that are considered good in esports. (heh...games in general--lol) I just enjoy playing them with friends.
       After college I had a hard look at myself and what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted a job that I didn't hate...so I have been really trying to save money up to start my own LAN Center/Esports Arena.
       One that would rival China and South Korea in or near my Home town. I have this crazy idea that I would become a Midwestern Hub for Esports tournaments, but that is very long time away.
       I've done a lot of groundwork for it like determining cost of operations (electricity used by consoles, computers and other electronics). How big of a Venue I want...very large...
       I currently have 3 dogs and 2 cats. The names of the dogs are Shadow, Max, and Zeref. The cats' names are Fuzzy and Meow Meow. Shadow and Fuzzy were "foster failures" meaning that they were being fostered by us and we ended up loving them too much.
       Max, Zeref, and Meow Meow were rescued off the street or from abusive homes. Max and Zeref fight like brothers. 
       I started going to college right after High School in 2012.
       I started out going into the Computer Engineering Techology degree because I wanted to work closely with computers. I now know that the Degree I should have taken was IT.
       This degree had a lot to do with Circuit Analysis, Visual C Programming, and FPGA Programming
       But because of my mistake I got to meet a couple of really cool guys. (They know who they are :D )
       We ended up becoming really good friends and took a lot of classes together. We worked together through the very hard problems together as well as bounced ideas off of each other.
       One of the ideas that was bounced around was Double Majoring. I was iffy at the time but eventually I caved and ended up taking a loan out to pay for the Second Degree (I was running off of FAFSA grants and Scholarships up to this point).
       And thats when I fell in love with programming. Sure I loved to mess around with circuits, but getting those circuits to dance to my will was more thrilling to me.
       I got to the very last class in the CS Degree and at the time I was going through some really hard times mentally. My friends had finished and decided to move on and out of Terre Haute. I tried to finish the Degree, but couldn't muster the motivation I once had before, I had to settle with an Associates Degree in Computer Science.
       Fast forward a year and things were not getting better for me. I had to take a Retail job at Walmart to pay bills and my loan and have been there since 2018. 
       Its been fine to work here at this establishment, but there were a lot of things I have realized while working here. I've learned how to communicate with my team effectively, how to work on a team in the first place, and the important skill I was looking for. Confidence in myself.
       I've met a lot of people through the last few years and a couple of them I actually like and talk to on a regular basis. (Thank you to those people who put up with me...haha.)
       Now I am more than ready to move on I think. I'm picking up a lot of skills to arm myself for what is to come. I am preparing myself for a prosperous life. The retail "itch" has been scratched and now I'm ready to move onto the next.
