            Hi there!<br>
            <br>
            My name is Jonathen and welcome to my little slice of the internet! I created this website to mainly get my name out there and hopefully
            attract employers as well prove to myself that I can do it as well as give myself a platform for inspiration.<br>
            <br>
            You can find many things on this website about me as well as my list of projects that I have completed/working on -- denoted by a [WIP] tag.
            Thank you for visiting and I hope you enjoy your visit today!<br>
            <br>
            Sincerely,<br>
            Jonathen Akens<br>
